## About

Really good little biscuits that Johann's Oma makes. Literally vanilla crescents. **This recipe is a translation from German.**

## Equipment

## Ingredients

- 280g Flour
- 80g Sugar
- 200g Butter
- 100g Ground Almonds
- 1 packet of Vanilla Sugar

## Steps
Knead sifted flour, sugar, cold butter (cut into small pieces), and the ground almonds in a bowl into a dough. Make small crescents from the dough, and bake them on a greased baking sheet until they are golden. While still hot, dust them in vanilla sugar.
