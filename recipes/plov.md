# Plov (Плов)

## About

Plov is essentially rice with chicken, carrots, onions, and some spices. It's a simple dish and can be made in one pan, but it makes for a nice lunch / dinner.
Originally an Uzbek / Central Asian dish (probably related to the Middle Eastern dish pilaf), it is now popular in Russia and other post-Soviet countries.

NB: This is not in any way authentic. Also, I am a programmer, not a cook. Follow this at your own risk :)

## Equipment 

- Wok (or a large deep pan / a pot)
- Lid
- Something to stir with

## Ingredients

Serves 2-3 people

- ~500g Long-grain rice
- 2x Chicken breasts (or ~4x boneless skinless thighs)
	- Mutton is more traditional and works great too, but chicken has the advantage of being ✨cheap(er)✨ and I am a student
- 4x Carrots
- 2x Onions (medium sized)
- ~2 Cups chicken stock
- 4 Cloves of garlic
- Cooking oil
- Coriander seeds, pepper
- (Optional) Extra spices:
	- 1 small chilli
	- Bay leaves, tumeric, other spices to taste

## Steps 

### Prep

1. Finely dice the onion
2. Roughly chop the carrots
3. Cut the chicken into medium sized pieces
4. Chop the chilli into small pieces - cut out the seeds if you don't like spice
5. *Important*: wash your rice well! It gets rid of excess starch (you don't want it to be gooey / mushy) and also is probably more hygienic anyway

### Cooking 

1. Put the pan on high heat and add plenty of cooking oil. I use a wok but any deep pan will do!
(Optional: sesame oil works well and adds a nice flavour!)
2. Fry the onion and chilli for ~5 minutes
3. Add the spices, garlic, and chicken
4. Cook for ~10 minutes, stirring occasionally - you want things to brown nicely, but not burn
5. Reduce the heat to medium-low
6. Add the stock and simmer for ~30 minutes
7. Add the rice, mix well and cover with a lid
8. Cook for ~30 minutes more (or until the rice is soft)
9. If it's burning too much, add some water and stir for a bit
10. Serve!

## Extras

1. A side of finely chopped tomatoes with some onion, garlic and coriander leaves goes well with it
2. I've tried using some beer to deglaze (together with the stock) and that worked well, but is a bit of a sacrilege
